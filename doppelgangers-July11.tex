\section{Rockwood}
The players have arrived at the town of Rockwood in search of the hooded stranger and are greeted with hostility

\begin{paperbox}{The Town}
Compared to the town of Gerburgh, Rockwood is a crowded metropolis.  As you wander into the town, you feel many eyes nervously tracking your moves.  The center of town houses a lovely circle with an elegant gazebo inside.  Six roads branch from the circle in all directions, allowing you to see many of the buildings from inside the structure.  As you look out, you are greeted with stares from every avenue.  A man in a uniform is running towards you.
\end{paperbox}

\begin{quotebox}
How dare you come back to Rockwood!  Despite your disguises, we all recognize you for the demons you are!
\end{quotebox}

\begin{commentbox}{Player Reaction}
The players may react civilly or violently to the accusation.  If the players respond with force, more policemen will come until they are overpowered.  This will make it more difficult for them to convince the officers they are not demons later.
\end{commentbox}

\subsection{The Jail}
The players learn about the events in Rockwood and find a way out of prison.
